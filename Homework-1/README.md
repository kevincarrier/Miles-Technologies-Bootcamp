## Homework 1

	1.	Try creating a script for it for your database design. This will make the database much more maintainable. Try “Seeding” the table/add dummy data 

	2.	The system should also be able to track Supplies. Supplies should have a unit and a name for instance “ounce” and “strong ale” There should also be a way to track counts. That is to say- inventory. It should have a supply Id, tavern id, and the date it was updated as well as the current count for that supply. There also needs to be a way to show what the tavern received. This will include supply id, tavern id, cost, the amount received, and date. 
		(Note: Supplies table and tavern IDs must exist in their respective tables)

	3.	Taverns should also provide services. Services should have a name (ie. Pool or Weapon sharpening). They should also have a status which should be a manageable list of values (stored in another table). For instance, ‘active’, ‘inactive’ but we may also want to add others down the line. Such as out of stock or discontinued. The database should also keep track of it with a sales table. This table will track service, guest, price, date purchased, amount purchased, and the tavern it belongs to 

Seed all tables with at least 5-10 rows of data each. Add some repeated fields to show normalization
